- [Rust standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/prelude/index.html)

- in Rust, variables are immutable by default

- _String_ is a string type provided by the Rust standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.

- _::_ syntax: associated function

- _&_ means reference. Like variable, references are immutable by default

- [Result type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/result/enum.Result.html) has two variants:
    - Ok: inside the _OK_ is the successfully generated value
    - Err: contains information about how or why the operation failed

- [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)

- _cargo update_ command will ignore the _Cargo.lock_ file and upate all dependencies

- This expression  _start..=end_ is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds

- build documentation provided by all dependencies locally and open it in your browser: _cargo doc --open_
